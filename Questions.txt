Q Rest and Rest Web API difference
Q Stack and Heap Memory: How it looks like
Q XSLT
Q. System.int32 and int 16
Q IIS Request Cycle
Q 
Q Why Delete by Post not get
Get Action delete can be called by Image or search which
is bad

Q Web API request is responded then how can we make this request alive

Q. If Timeout error is coming due to process time then how can we 
manage it for client response

Q What is dependency injection. How many ways we can pass parameter
Q. What are two ways to make LINQ query optimized. Lazy loading in LINQ
Q Why Singleton if Static Class is doing same
While a static class allows only static methods and you cannot pass static class as parameter. A Singleton can implement interfaces, inherit from other classes and allow inheritance. While a static class cannot inherit their instance members. So Singleton is more flexible than static classes and can maintain state.
Singleton patterns are used in logging, caches, thread pools, configuration settings, device driver objects.
